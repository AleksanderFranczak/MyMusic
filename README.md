## MyMusic - app that alows you to discover new tracks!
App uses spotify api to display user top tracks an artists and allow them to create new playlist based on the tracks and artists they select

So far it is my biggest react project i used here a lot of technologies and created some complex logic ( atleast i think it is complex).

## Technologies
react with hooks
styled-components
redux ( managing notifications,async actions)


react-router ( protected routes, handling OAuth callbacks)
